# Sklearn-homework

The purpose of this assignment is to develop, test and evaluate different learning models in order to determine how accurate they are
in determining weather cancer tumors are malignant or begning 

The code doesnt really use classes but is mostly made up of sklearn classifiers to curate different learning models 

The data is divided up and 75% is used for training the model while 25% is used for testing 

The methods used include 

train_test_split: This divides the dataset into training and testing sets 
fit: This is used for training the models on the training data.
predict: This generates predictions for the test data based on the trained models.
accuracy_score: Calculates the fraction of correctly classified samples.
f1_score: Combines precision and recall
precision_score: Measures how many of the predicted positive values are actually positive.
recall_score: Measures how many of the actual positive values were predicted correctly.
